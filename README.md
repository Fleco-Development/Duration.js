# Duration.js

*This is a work in progress*

This is a fork of [Duration.js](https://github.com/icholy/Duration.js) by [icholy](https://github.com/icholy)

I have based the code off of the `golang_compatible` branch, updating the code to TypeScript and using ESM.

It has also basically turned into a wrapper for the [Temporal.Duration](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html) from a polyfill for the Temporal Proposal.

## Tests

Since this is a work in progress, there are no tests yet.
